# Description
This repository is designed to be a refresher course on c++. You should start at the first module that you aren't confident on and then move on in order from there. The modules are roughly ordered by difficulty and range from the complete basics to advanced c++. 

# What's in a module?
Each module has a file named `main.cpp`, a file or set of files with answer\_ as a prefix, and a README.md. 

`main.cpp` is the file that you should compile and run when you want to test your answer

`answer_` are files that contain a sample answer to the test. You should avoid looking at this if you want to get anything from this course unless you are really stuck.

`README.md` contains the goals of this lesson and some helpful hints if you get stuck.

# What's it for?
While this "course" was designed to be a refresher course for c++ I've decided while creating it that it could be used in more ways than that. You could go through this as a test of your fluency in c++ to see how proficient you are in c++. In which case, I would reccomend you try to start at the module you think you might have trouble with. You could also use this as a guide to c++ from scratch. There are certainly better alternatives, but if you choose to do this know that there are not explanations for much of the answers. Because of this you will definitely need to do a lot of searching (check out the READMEs for tips on searching) and this should just be your test of progress. Lastly, you could use this as intended and do each module to ensure that you remember all your c++ essentials.

# How to use it
Each module will have you write some code in one or more files. You will compile the file `main.cpp` and run the resulting binary. In some modules there are extra binaries already provided called `check` which will check your answers. If a `check` binary is not included than `main.cpp` checks your answers by itself. After running all the proper files you will get a message telling you whether your code failed or passed the checks. It is possible to cheat some of the answers, but because this is for personal growth you should try to complete the modules as described (otherwise whats the point?). I reccomend starting from the beginning just to make sure you know everything, because each module grows on the previous and expects you to know how to use the concepts from the previous modules.
